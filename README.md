## ðŸ“˜ Description

This repository contains practical lab assignments for a university-level Machine Learning course (Spring 2025). The labs gradually build foundational and advanced concepts in machine learning, starting from basic data manipulation to building and training deep learning models such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs.

Each notebook demonstrates a different concept with step-by-step implementation and real-world datasets like AEP load forecasting data.

The final labs include a custom-designed CNN and a state-of-the-art model (GoogLeNet) for image classification tasks.
